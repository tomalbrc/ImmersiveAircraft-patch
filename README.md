## Patch ImmersiveAircraft to work server-side only

Using a Resourcepack + Polymer + PolyMC + blockbench-import-library

For Minecraft 1.20.1, requires PolyMC, Polymer and Immersive Aircraft

- You can dismount the vehicles using shift+space (sneak+jump keys)
- Open the inventory using "F" (switch items key) while riding/flying


TODO:
- The Inventories are extremely basic and slightly incomplete for certain vehicles but work mostly
- Some models are buggy incomplete
- Rider positions are incorrect
- Damage tint does not show
- Engine start/fuel GUI doesnt work yet
- Particles seem odd
- No input for boost/weapons
